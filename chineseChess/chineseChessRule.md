### GUARD

- Must stay within the palace.
- Moves exactly one point diagonally.

### Elephant

- Moves two points diagonally.
- Cannot cross the river.
- Cannot jump over intervening pieces (the “Elephant Eye” must be clear).

### Horse

- Moves one point orthogonally, then one point diagonally outward.
- Cannot move if the orthogonal square in the path is occupied (Horse Leg rule).

### Rook

- Moves any number of spaces orthogonally.
- Movement can be blocked by intervening pieces.

### Cannon

- Moves like a Rook when **not capturing**.
- To **capture**, must jump over exactly **one piece** between itself and the target.
- Cannot jump more than one piece when capturing.

### SOLDIER/PAWN

- Moves forward one point.
- After crossing the river, can also move sideways (never backward).
